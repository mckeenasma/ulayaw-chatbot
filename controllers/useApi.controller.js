I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac. I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years: Let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling. In fact, most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected. In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care.\n\nI have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of: First off, I would recommend seeing your doctor and getting a physical exam. If you have an underlying health problem, that needs to be addressed. If you don’t, I would recommend seeing a therapist and talking about your feelings.\n\nI’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me: If you are feeling this way, you may be at high risk for self-harm. I would recommend going to the nearest hospital and asking to see a doctor. They will be able to help you and direct you to the support you need.\n\nHow can I get to a place where I can be content from day to day?: This is a great question. First, you need to know that being content from day to day is a skill that can be learned. I would recommend seeing a therapist and developing this skill together.\n\n${res1.text}:`,
